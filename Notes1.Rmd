## R Markdown

**Git** helps me to ***edit***, ***track*** and ***share*** my changes to R scripts.

#### The following are a few examples of the use of R code

In line calculation `r ((43 - 17)*.1)^2`

#### A code block

```{r}
((43 - 17)*.1)^2
```

#### A code block which does not echo the source text

```{r echo=FALSE}
((43 - 17)*.1)^2
```
